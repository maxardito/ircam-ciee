# IRCAM Max/MSP Patches

A collection of Max/MSP patchers organized by topics, ranging from MIDI sequencing and modular synthesis to granular synthesis and real-time DSP techniques.

> This repository is designed for use in an educational context, providing practical examples and creative tools for sound design, synthesis, and algorithmic composition in Max. Be sure to contextualize this stuff historically alongside supplementary reading and listening. These concepts didn't just fall from the sky! ☔

## 📁 Folder Structure
Each `class_X_*` folder contains Max patchers and supporting files related to a specific topic:
- `class_1_MIDI` – General MIDI, propability, composition with Markov chains 
- `class_2_modular-synth` – FM, AM, modular synthesis, Scala tunings 
- `class_3_mc` – Multichannel (MC) synthesis intro, MC macro messages, voice allocation
- `class_4_buffers` – Working with buffers, wavetables, sample manipulation, and sequencers
- `class_5_granular-synth_filters` – Granular synthesis, FIR/IIR filters, delays 
- `class_6_realtime-DSP` – Basic audio effects, circular buffers, matrix routing, onset detection
- `class_7_spat_fft` – Analysis/resynthesis, phase vocoder, spectral freeze, spatialization 
- `class_8_noise` – Feedback, waveshaping, harsh noise, degradation
- `class_9_jitter` - Reactive sensors, live visuals, OpenGL

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Max/MSP 8.0 or higher  
- SPAT
